# Handoff: FactorySimulation Phase A Complete

Updated: 2026-05-27

## Current State

Repository: `DongHwanKim-0721/FactorySimulation`

Local workspace: `C:\Users\IJMAIL\vscode-python\FactorySimulation`

Remote: `https://github.com/DongHwanKim-0721/FactorySimulation`

Latest Phase A implementation commit pushed to `origin/main`:

- `3993c5f Implement phase A simulation engine`
- Full SHA: `3993c5f3c479e2747435e0d11782ab623a0c93b1`

GitHub issue state at handoff time:

- Phase A umbrella issue `#5` closed as completed
- Implementation issues `#6` through `#11` closed as completed
- No open issues remained

Important update:

- This handoff records the earlier Phase A definition that used an EA-level push scheduler.
- The active Phase A scope has since been redefined by `docs/prd/phase-a-bundle-hoist-redefinition.md` and GitHub issue `#12`.
- For new implementation work, treat this file as historical context only.

## What Changed

Phase A simulation engine replacement is complete. Use these references instead of duplicating implementation details here:

- PRD: `docs/prd/phase-a-simulation-engine.md`
- Commit: `3993c5f3c479e2747435e0d11782ab623a0c93b1`
- GitHub issues: `#5`, `#6`, `#7`, `#8`, `#9`, `#10`, `#11`

High-level scope covered:

- EA-based simulation contract using `units_per_source`, `total_generated_units`, and `source_count`
- deterministic event scheduler with capacity as parallel EA slots
- stable DAG validation and topological ordering
- branch routing by child capacity without unit duplication
- FIFO merge handling and multi-sink total time
- GUI input/result language updated to EA terminology
- pytest import path and generated Python artifact ignore rules added

## Verification

Commands run successfully:

```powershell
python -m py_compile app.py engine\simulation.py engine\models.py engine\scenario_io.py
python -m pytest
pytest
git diff --check
```

Final test result:

- `14 passed`

## Notes For Next Agent

There is currently no queued implementation issue. Start by checking local and remote state:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
git pull --ff-only
```

Then inspect the issue tracker:

- `https://github.com/DongHwanKim-0721/FactorySimulation/issues`

Known caveat:

- GUI manual smoke testing was not automated. The engine and app compile, and tests pass, but a human visual check of the tkinter UI is still useful if the next task touches GUI behavior.

## Suggested Skills

- `diagnose`: use if the next session reports a bug, failed test, or GUI/runtime issue.
- `to-prd`: use if the next session defines the next product phase.
- `to-issues`: use if a new plan or PRD needs to be broken into GitHub issues.
- `handoff`: use again before ending a future multi-step session.
